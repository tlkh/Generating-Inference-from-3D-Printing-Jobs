# Generating Inference from 3D Printing Jobs
The purpose of this project is to explore how data analytics and machine learning algorithms can be used to derive usable or actionable data on 3D printing services.

The target of this study is the SUTD Class of 2020 Freshmore cohort. Every cohort class (of about 45 people each) has access to two Edison+ 3D Printers in their cohort classrooms.
